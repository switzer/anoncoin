Building Anoncoin from source

When all the required dependencies have already been built, compiling Anoncoin from source could be as simple as executing the following commands in the Anoncoin root directory

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

This will create the binaries src/anoncoind, src/anoncoin-cli, and src/qt/anoncoin-qt.

To run the test suite, execute

make check

Detailed platform-specific build instructions can be found in the files doc/INSTALLATION_*.md
